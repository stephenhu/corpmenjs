# game

corpmen is a linear progression rpg and simulator played in a modern office/technology park setting, instead of battling monsters in dungeons, players will battle colleagues, bosses, other corporations to climb the corporate ladder!

the game is broken down into chapters, each chapter has various missions or objectives and to complete a chapter, certain goals must be accomplished such as getting a certain level of experience or completing certain missions.  if players choose not to engage on missions, there is a level of freedom given to explore the map and interact with the corpmen world.

corpmen will be an indie game, not necessarily for profit.

## title

corpmen is sort of a play on words of the japanese word _salaryman_ meaning work slave.  it is not meant to be gender specific, it will be playable by men or women.

## map

the map will basically be a technology park with multiple companies and office buildings within the park, each building will consist of multiple floors, as you reach higher floors, the monsters and missions will become more and more challenging.

## art

2d, pixel based, like final fantasy 1/2 or the original zelda game.  i want to focus on speed of development, artwork, low animation and make sure that the game play is fun.

in the future, a sequel could be considered for 3d with higher end graphics and animation.

## play

single player only, this game will not need an internet connection and can be played locally.

## platform

for ios/mac ecosystem only for now.  can port to android later.

## story

the company will be a high tech company like in the bay area, it will be slightly fictionalized, but everyone should be able to tell that it's silicon valley.  players will start from a low level engineer role and work your way up eventually to potentially chairman of the board.  there will be various chapters that progress the story.
