# levels

each level is physically a floor in the company's high rise building which is the equivalent of an rpg dungeon, as you wander around the office, there will be various conflicts/battles that arise where players can increase their experience and skill sets.  the higher you go up in terms of floors, the more challenging the battles.

players can randomly wander around the level to gain experience or complete missions to move the story forward.
