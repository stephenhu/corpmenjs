# game play

corpmen is a linear progression rpg and simulator, players gain experience by completing tasks,
missions, and enhance their skills through various stories.  the game is broken down into
chapters, each chapter has various missions or objectives, and to complete a chapter, certain
goals must be accomplished such as getting a certain level of experience.

* select player name, customization, player gets random attributes
* allocate points to various attributes e.g. intelligence
* select your company based on different profiles (optional)
* select different roles within a company (optional)

these are the events that the player controls throughout the game, some will be directly imposed
on the player, others are based on the player's discretion.

* scenes
* tasks
* meetings
* missions
* cooler talk
* external hiring
* chapter

## scenes

this will be an event that occurs based on the progression of the game, in the beginning as an example,
there will be a new onboarding experience, an introduction to the company, some of its leaders, your role, goals, maybe some of the competition or news.  these will be interspersed with regular game play.

## tasks

you will be assigned multiple tasks, based on skills, the tasks will take various times to execute and
these happen asynchronously, each player will have limited capacity to take on tasks, some with greater
ability can execute multiple tasks in parallel.  tasks will have certain deadlines, so players need to
manage these.  an example is your boss could assign you a weekly tps report that you need to submit before
5pm on fridays.  this takes x amount of time, if your execution attribute is higher, this may only take you 
a few minutes, if your execution attribute is low, it will take much longer.  these tasks will also have
bearing on your morale, health, etc.

by working on tasks, the ones that are meaningful will have positive impact on your attributes, like if
you work on a lot of analysis tasks then you will be awarded additional points for the analysis attribute.
skills will also be given for completion of certain numbers of tasks.

some examples of tasks, some depend on the player's role i.e. manager versus individual:

* tps reports
* data analysis
* presentation
* spreadsheet
* document
* budget
* planning
* scheduling
* performance review
* re-organization/layoffs
* assignment (this will be various like a bug fix or vendor payment, depends on role)

## meetings

too many meetings will drain players and prevent players from achieving tasks, some are
necessary, others are a complete waste of time, and failure to attend mandatory meetings
will be cause for disciplinary action.

types of meetings:

* 1x1
* team meetings (frequency can evolve)
* all hands/townhall
* external meetings
* random request

## missions

missions will have certain objectives, unlike tasks, these count more towards story progression.
these will have goals aligned and typically a boss to beat at the end.  the first chapter's boss
is mindy vasquez which will be a mini-boss, she is actually a peer, but a more senior peer who
has the boss' trust, you will need to defeat her using your various skills, this will be like
an rpg turn based battle.  chapters will consist of various missions and once you hit a certain
target, the chapter will be completed.

## basic flow

this will attempt to describe the basic flow during a player
session.

* upon start, user will start a new game
* user prompted for player name (first, last), gender, customize look (later feature)
* scene starts describing Big, Inc, new hire orientation
* next will find user at his desk, boss will come by to welcome and say hello, he will ask you to introduce yourself to the rest of the team


* you will meet with your boss who is a real idiot in a 1x1.
