# game play

these are the events that the player controls throughout the game, some will be directly imposed on the player, others are based on the player's discretion.

* scenes
* battle
* task management (including meetings)
* missions
* exploring

## scenes

this will be an event that occurs based on the progression of the game, in the beginning as an example, there will be a new onboarding experience, an introduction to the company, some of its leaders, your role, goals, maybe some of the competition or news.  these will be interspersed with regular game play and move the story along.

## battle

players will be engaged in random battles as you move around on the map or as part of an objective in a mission like beating your boss, these battles will be against different "monsters" in the game, each level will introduce varying difficulty of monsters.  monsters will
really just be colleagues from different departments, different roles, like HR, engineering, finance, or abstract things like computers,software that's used at the office, partners, vendors, etc.  this is a turn based battle system which will require different weapons and skill sets.  weapons in corpmen will not be physical weapons like swords and guns, it will be things like computers, spreadsheets, skills like being candid, or such.  at the end of the day, they operate much like spells, weapons as they take off damage, each monster has hitpoints, and you can gain experience.

corpmen will allow banding of team members to create a group to battle against monsters.

## task management

task management will be a major event that each player will need to balance, throughout employment, players will be assigned multiple tasks such as weekly reports, attending team meetings.  based on each player's skill level, the tasks will take various times to execute and
these happen asynchronously, each player will have limited capacity to take on tasks, some with greater
ability can execute multiple tasks in parallel.  tasks will have certain deadlines, so players need to
manage these.  an example is your boss could assign you a weekly tps report that you need to submit before
5pm on fridays.  this takes x amount of time, if your execution attribute is higher, this may only take you 
a few minutes, if your execution attribute is low, it will take much longer.  these tasks will also have
bearing on your morale, health, etc.

by working on tasks, the ones that are meaningful will have positive impact on your attributes, like if
you work on a lot of analysis tasks then you will be awarded additional points for the analysis attribute.
skills will also be given for completion of certain numbers of tasks.

some examples of tasks, some depend on the player's role i.e. manager versus individual:

* tps reports
* data analysis
* presentation
* spreadsheet
* document
* budget
* planning
* scheduling
* performance review
* re-organization/layoffs
* assignment (this will be various like a bug fix or vendor payment, depends on role)

### meetings

too many meetings will drain players and prevent players from achieving tasks, some are necessary, others are a complete waste of time, and failure to attend mandatory meetings will be cause for disciplinary action and the likeness to drop between colleagues or boss.

types of meetings:

* 1x1
* team meetings (frequency can evolve)
* all hands/townhall
* external meetings
* random request

## missions

missions will have certain objectives, unlike tasks, these count more towards story progression.
these will have goals aligned and typically a boss to beat at the end.  the first chapter's boss
is mindy vasquez which will be a mini-boss, she is actually a peer, but a more senior peer who
has the boss' trust, you will need to defeat her using your various skills, this will be like
an rpg turn based battle.  chapters will consist of various missions and once you hit a certain
target, the chapter will be completed.

## exploring

players can take their own path by exploring the map, find rare items, engage in random battles to grind out attributes, or build relationships with other colleagues.

## basic flow

this will attempt to describe the basic flow of the game:

* select player name, customization, player gets random attributes
* allocate points to various attributes e.g. intelligence
* select your company based on different profiles (optional)
* select different roles within a company (optional)
* upon start, user will start a new game
* user prompted for player name (first, last), gender, customize look (later feature)
* scene starts describing Big, Inc, new hire orientation
* next will find user at his desk, boss will come by to welcome and say hello, he will ask you to introduce yourself to the rest of the team
* meeting each team member will be a task, each task completion will add relevant experience
* from a task interface, you can choose and schedule which tasks to happen.  interspersed with these tasks will be various meetings.  juggling these tasks and meetings will be part of the game play
* you can also wander around the office and meet different colleagues, from this you'll gain information much like in other rpg's
* battles will occur, but these are not to the death, it's more like a conflict that you need to resolve, these will pop up randomly as you're walking around the office, each floor will represent different levels like a dungeon, the higher the floor, the harder the conflicts or enemies.  rpg's typically can have deaths, like the player dies and gets reincarnated, i will need to think about the experience here.
* experience will be gathered to gain new skills, there will be a skills tree.
* part of the game play will also be completing missions, missions will require multiple objectives and skills to complete, this will also move the story along.


## character relationships

these are meters that change over time, ranges from -500 to 500

* respect
* alignment
* trust
* reporting
